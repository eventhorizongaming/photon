# Photon.js

> [!NOTE]
> The project in the `public/old` folder has been temporarily placed on hold in favour of `public/physics`, where the physics aspect of the library is being designed independently.  This is to provide a more focused development plan - we'll start with physics, then move on to the core node system and graphics instead of attempting to develop everything simultaneously.
